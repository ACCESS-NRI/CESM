CESM is comprised of a number of different 'external' components that
are developed and managed independently. Each component may have
additional 'external' dependancies and optional parts that are also
developed and managed independently.

The checkout_model.py tool manages retreiving and updating the externals
so you have a complete set of source files for the model.

checkout_model relies on a model description file that describes what
components are needed, where to find them and where to put them in the
source tree. The default file is called "CESM.xml" regardless of
whether you are checking out CESM or a standalone component.

NOTE: checkout_model.py *MUST* be run from the root of the source tree it
is managing. For example, if you cloned CLM with:

    $ git clone git@github.com/ncar/clm clm-dev

Then the root of the source tree is /path/to/cesm-dev. If you obtained
CLM via an svn checkout of CESM and you need to checkout the CLM
externals, then the root of the source tree for CLM is:

    /path/to/cesm-dev/components/clm

The root of the source tree will be referred to as ${SRC_ROOT} below.

To get started quickly, checkout all required components from the
default model description file:

    $ cd ${SRC_ROOT}
    $ ./checkout_cesm/checkout_model.py

For additional information about using checkout model, please see:

    ${SRC_ROOT}/checkout_cesm/README

or run:

    $ cd ${SRC_ROOT}
    $ ./checkout_cesm/checkout_model.py --help
